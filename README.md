# Symbion: A Framework for Governance Through Systemic Balance

Symbion is an open framework to model, simulate, and optimize governance decisions using structured resources, plug-and-play policies, and AI-driven causal inference.

## Core Concepts

- **Resource Entities**: Represent national systems (e.g., Education, Water, Economy).
- **Resource State Chain**: Immutable blockchain-style timeline of resource states.
- **Policy Plugins**: Modular logic units that simulate and affect multiple resources.
- **AI Recommender**: Learns from causal graphs to recommend optimal policies.
- **Governance Sandbox UI**: Visual tool for simulating and exploring policy impact.

## Repo Structure

```
/core                 # .NET Core backend engine
/plugins              # Community and official policy plugins
/ui                   # React-based governance sandbox UI
/docs                 # AsciiDoc specifications and contributor guides
/.github/workflows    # GitHub Actions for CI/CD
```

## Get Started

1. Read the spec in `docs/SPEC-001-Symbion.adoc`
2. Clone the repo and run the backend engine in `/core`
3. Contribute a policy in `/plugins`
4. Explore the system through the UI in `/ui`

## Contributing

- Submit policy plugins via pull request to the `/plugins` folder
- Add new resource types or relationships through JSON/YAML definitions
- Review open issues for areas needing domain expertise
