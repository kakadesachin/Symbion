= SPEC-001: Symbion Governance Framework
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

Modern nation-states face increasingly complex challenges balancing natural, economic, human, and social resources. Traditional governance structures struggle to maintain systemic equilibrium due to fragmented data, short-term decision making, and lack of feedback loops.

This project proposes a unified framework to model a nation's core components as structured resources, akin to software APIs or RESTful entities. The system enables real-time feedback, simulations, and optimization using AI, enabling better governance decisions that preserve richness, sustainability, and equity.

A nation that implements this framework can simulate future scenarios, understand systemic consequences, and develop data-informed policy decisions that optimize long-term well-being.

== Requirements

The framework must satisfy the following requirements, categorized using MoSCoW prioritization:

=== Must Have
- Unified and abstract representation of all national resources (e.g., natural, human, economic, social).
- Resource and policy models must be versioned, extensible, and semantically linked using a shared ontology.
- Modular policy engine with plug-and-play capabilities; policies can be defined independently and applied declaratively.
- Declarative schema or DSL to define new resource types, indicators, and policy logic.
- AI-driven simulation and recommendation system that works on unified data structures.
- Clear separation between data ingestion, simulation logic, and recommendation layer.

=== Should Have
- Visual governance dashboard for administrators and policy makers.
- External integration layer for real-world data ingestion and policy triggers.
- Simulation history tracking with full reproducibility and explainability of AI recommendations.

=== Could Have
- Cross-country model comparison to share learnings and best practices.
- Natural language query system (e.g., "What if we reduce energy subsidies by 20%?").
- Support for open data APIs for researchers and external bodies.

=== Won’t Have (initially)
- Real-time enforcement of decisions or control over government infrastructure.
- Invasive citizen-level surveillance or identity tracking (unless explicitly opted-in).

=== Architecture Overview

package "Governance Core Engine (.NET Core)" {
  [Resource Registry] --> [Resource State Chain]
  [Policy Engine] --> [Resource Registry]

=== Resource State Modeling

Each resource is tracked over time using an immutable block-style chain:

- `ResourceStateBlock`:
  - `id`
  - `resource_id`
  - `timestamp`
  - `data`
  - `policy_applied`
  - `previous_hash`
  - `hash`

=== Resource Relationships

All resources are part of a semantic relationship graph.

[plantuml, relationship-graph, svg]
----
@startuml
object Education
object Employment
object GDP
object Energy

Education --> Employment : +0.8
Employment --> GDP : +0.6
Energy --> GDP : +0.4
Energy --> Education : -0.2

These relationships enable systemic simulation and causal modeling.

=== Policy Plugin System

==== DSL Example

```yaml
id: policy.education.investment
name: "Increase Education Funding"
targets:
  - resource: Education
    change: { budget: "+10%" }
effects:
  - from: Education
    to: Employment
    weight: 0.7
    delay: "6 months"
```

==== Code Interface

```csharp
public interface IPolicyPlugin
{
    string Id { get; }
    string Name { get; }
    Task<ResourceDelta[]> ApplyAsync(ResourceContext context);
}
```

==== Public Registry

Hosted on GitHub, policies and resources are submitted via PRs. CI validates correctness and simulation behavior.

== Implementation

=== Month 0–3: Core Engine Foundation
- Monorepo setup, Resource Chain, Policy Engine (DSL)
- Local CLI runner + low-cost backend hosting

=== Month 4–6: Plugin System & Registry
- DSL + code plugin support
- GitHub-based plugin registry
- Resource Relationship Graph

=== Month 7–9: Governance Sandbox UI
- React-based UI with resource graph, simulation tools
- Policy testing & visualization

=== Month 10–12: AI Engine + Community Growth
- Train AI on causal graphs
- Explainable recommendation engine
- Public case studies and partnership outreach

== Gathering Results

=== Policy Validation and Expert Oversight
- Domain-expert reviews, metadata tagging
- Governance board for core system contributions

=== Simulation Accuracy
- Track simulation outcomes vs. real-world metrics
- Feedback loop into AI models

=== Community Metrics
- Plugin counts, simulation runs, adoption stats
- Open dashboards and case studies

=== Cost Monitoring
- Support low-cost deploy targets (Fly.io, Pi, SQLite)
- Publish operating cost benchmarks
